# [0.5.2-beta2] - 2025-02-16

## Added

- Add config option to disable RegionMarker creation through renaming a Stick in an Anvil
- Add compat with [Snow! Real Magic!](<https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/snow-real-magic>) - closes [Issue #152](<https://github.com/Z0rdak/Yet-Another-World-Protector/issues/152>)
- Add new `playerHasBypassPermission(IProtectedRegion, Player);` in `de.z0rdak.yawp.api.permission`.

## Changed

- (API) Reworked and moved around some helpers for flag checking

## Fixed

- (Fabric) Fix `spawning-all` flag not excluding item entities. This fixes item deleting when using this flag in combination with the `item-drop` flag.
- Fix item entities or entities like armor stand, paintings, etc. de-spawning when adding `spawning-all` flag to a region.
- Renaming a stick in an Anvil does not consider the input name and will always result in a RegionMarker
- Fix missing info logging for config options
- Fix owners and members of child region not bypassing flag if parent denies the same flag
